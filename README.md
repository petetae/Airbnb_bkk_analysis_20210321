## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>

AirBnB has been everywhere around the world. This analysis is to identify the current state of its value in Bangkok and to identify potential interesting insights.
AirBnB has a lot of open data available to analyse and this project references the free data to identify insights around the host count, listing, and value predictions.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.
The Jupyter Notebook file can be downloaded and run without issues.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Interestingly, there is a lot of free open data relating to AirBnB. So this small side project looks to try and answer the following business questions:


Business question 1: What are the top 10 most common amenities for AirBnB listings in Bangkok?

Business question 2: What are the top 10 ares in Bangkok with the most listing value? How many listings are there?

Business question 3: What are the growth trend in number of AirBnB hosts overtime in Bangkok?

Business question 4: What is the latest total value of AirBnB listings in Bangkok? 

Business question 5: Given an estimated number of listing at the end of the year 2021, what would be our total listing value predictions?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is everything in one notebook for analysis and the attached csv files for the AirBnB listing data used for analysis.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

Main findings and analysis can also be found at https://pete-taecha.medium.com/is-airbnb-secretly-dominating-bangkok-419b676a23e9 link and in the pdf.
Overall, there is a strong growth trend in AirBnB domination in Bangkok and let's see whether they are going to further penetrate the market or not.
